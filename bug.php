In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with array keys that are not explicitly defined. Consider this scenario:  ```php $myArray = []; $myArray["someKey"] = "someValue"; if(isset($myArray["anotherKey"])) { echo "Key exists"; } else { echo "Key does not exist"; } ``` If you expect `"Key does not exist"` to be printed, you might be surprised to see that it doesn't, even though "anotherKey" is never assigned to the array. PHP's loose typing allows for the creation of array keys on the fly and accessing them without explicit definition. This results in the code silently treating "anotherKey" as a key with a value of NULL. This can lead to hard-to-debug issues if you rely on `isset()` to verify the presence of keys. To illustrate the issue, this example prints an unexpected result because PHP creates the key "anotherKey": ```php $myArray = []; echo isset($myArray["anotherKey"]) ? "Key exists" : "Key does not exist"; //Output: Key exists ```
